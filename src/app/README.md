# About iteratation-1/book-list

This folder contains the application logic of the BookMonkey 2 demo.
Please refer to chapter 6.1 in the book.

To make this a full runnable application,
you have to create a new angular-cli project with `ng new book-monkey`
and place the folders content here:

```
book-monkey (main folder - auto generated by CLI)
   |
   +-- src (auto generated by CLI)
        |
        +-- app (THIS FOLDER)
```

Our build-server is actually doing this, it creates a new angular-cli project and overwrites the app folder.
You can see the final result here:
